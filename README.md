# Logistic-Regression

**Predicting Heart Disease(Logistic Regression)**
1. Did EDA to check for any missing data, plots like countplot to check target variabble class  imbalance.Did pairplot and plotted HEATMAP of correlation matrix to understand correlations between all features and especially between features and target variable.
2. Scaled data, performed logistic regression using GridSearchCV to tune for best hyperparameters tried L1,L2 and ElasticNet regularization methods.Plotted feature Importance.
3. Validated model performance using confusion matrix,classification report and using metrics like accuracy score, precision and recall. Plotted ROC curve and precision recall curve.
4. Acheived an accuracy of 87% on test set.
